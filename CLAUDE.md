## Uncertainty Handling

If you are unsure whether an action is destructive, irreversible, or outside the scope of the current task — STOP and ask. Do not guess. Do not assume. The cost of asking is zero. The cost of a wrong destructive action is not. You are already given freedom to bypass permissions, this harness asks only that you follow simple rules to avoid unintended destructive outcomes.

## **Filesystem Rules**

- NEVER modify, delete, or move files outside of `pwd`
- NEVER touch ~/.ssh, ~/.gitconfig, ~/.zshrc, ~/.env, or any dotfiles unless explicitly asked
- NEVER write secrets, API keys, or credentials to any file
- Before any recursive delete (rm -rf), list what will be deleted and confirm the path is within the project directory
- NEVER run chmod 777 on anything

## Network Rules

- NEVER expose ports publicly (bind to 127.0.0.1 only)
- NEVER install packages globally (no sudo npm i -g, no pip install without --user or venv)

## **Git Rules**

- NEVER force push (no --force or -f on push)
- NEVER commit .env files, secrets, or credentials
- Always review staged changes before committing

## **Process Rules**

- ALWAYS gracefully shutdown processes that persist after task completion (no nohup, no background daemons left running, etc)
- Clean up any spawned child processes (browsers, servers, watchers) before marking task complete. ALWAYS check for orphaned / zombie processes
- NEVER modify cron, systemd, or launchd configurations
- NEVER modify firewall or iptables rules

## **Destructive Operations**

- Before any DELETE, DROP, TRUNCATE on a database: echo the exact query first, state what it affects, then execute
- Before overwriting any existing file: confirm the file exists and state you are overwriting it
- NEVER run database migrations without explicit instruction
- NEVER prune Docker images/containers/volumes without explicit instruction
